//! # Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM)
//!
//! `rust-efsm` provides a Rust implementation of the EFSM mostly defined in \[1\]. In this crate, an EFSM
//! is simply referred to as a [machine](Machine). A machine defines a language by __accepting__
//! and __rejecting__ different input sequences called words. Machines should be specified using the
//! [builder](MachineBuilder).
